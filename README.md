A simple axios-based http client for interacting with profilic-server.

In order to use *profilic-client*, you must first install *[profilic-server](https://github.com/lululeon/profilic-server)*.

# Not intended for general use
Both profilic-client and profilic-server are packages in their complete infancy, and not recommended for production use. They are part of a learning exercise and were built as part of a prototype. Fork/use at your own risk.
